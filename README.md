# GMol-A (Affinity) 

Affinity prediction model using virtual nodes to consider water molecules. 
To-be integrated with GalaxyMol, a general biomolecule structure prediction model. 
This repository was built to test an architecture that utilizes GVP-GNN to consider not only water molecule coordinates but their polarity vector.
